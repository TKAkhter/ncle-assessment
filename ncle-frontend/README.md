## Notes

* I have worked on Angular 4 years ago and many things have changed in angular. This is due to the fact that many companies and client that I had worked with prefer ReactJs over Angular
* I had used ionic to some capacity in project
* I have added tailwind library in project to have a more consistent and clean code
* I am currently working with my company and task was assigned in week days so I didn't get the chance to show my true potential
* Due to resticted time many of future features can not be added
* It's a small request but try to keep assessments or evalaution tests small. To ensure efficiency, please consider a more concise coding challenge, typically completed in 2 hours or more, that still assesses my skills effectively. I'm happy to demonstrate my abilities via project assessment or live call assessment while respecting both our time constraints.

## Future Goals
* Connect frontend to backend 
* Add husky
* Add Lint styles
* Add Prettier
* Add State Management Library 
* Add end-to-end frontend test cases
